    st.markdown("For example: `Thibault` is a name that became popular in the 90s, so the average age at death is at 31. In the previous charts, when we filter the deaths with first name, we can observe that the age where most of `Thibault` die is mostly 0, corresponding to natality deaths.")
    st.markdown("But, as we know, natality deaths is most likely around 5% of total deaths. So, that means that most of the `Thibault` are still alive.")
